# publications_forms
This repo hosts the HTML forms for NYU WIRELESS's publication database. These HTML forms are where faculty members are making selections about what research area each of the their research papers belongs in. It also gives faculty members the option of adding "other" research areas that are used as tags on the website to further classify.
